# Travel Retrieval System

The Travel Retrieval System is a personalized travel recommendation system based on user preferences and social connections. It utilizes content and collaborative filtering recommender systems to offer tailored suggestions for tourist attractions in major cities in Indonesia. This project was developed as part of the Capstone Project Bangkit Academy 2021.

## Overview

The project aims to provide users with personalized travel recommendations based on their preferences, including city, price, category, and time constraints. By combining content-based and collaborative filtering techniques, the system generates final recommendation scores for users and locations, offering practical travel suggestions.

## Functionalities

1. **User Preferences Handling**: Manages user preferences such as city, price, category, and time constraints to provide tailored recommendations.
2. **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends tourist attractions based on content information and user interests.
3. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends tourist attractions based on similarities with other users' preferences and behavior.
4. **Optimal Route Calculation**: Provides users with the fastest and cheapest routes for visiting tourist attractions, enhancing their travel experience.
5. **Scoring Mechanism**: Calculates a final recommendation score for each user-location pair by combining content and collaborative systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for backend development and algorithms.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing, including reading datasets and organizing data.
- **Scikit-learn**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms for collaborative filtering.
- **Geopy**: Geocoding and distance calculation for incorporating geographic influence.
